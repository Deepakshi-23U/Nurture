# Nurture : Vaccine Guards, Loving starts: For healthy babies, Moms and Pups with Smarts
GDSC Solution Challenge 2024

Nurture is a one way platform for parents of pets and babies to get their little one vaccinated. It provides multiple features such as finding a nearby clinic and booking an appointment, keeping track of all your appointments due and done, and an information page with links to government documents. We provide an additional feature of notice board in the animal segment of our website where users can see all the animals that are up for adoption, and can either adopt a pup or put their pet up for adoption if they are unable to take further care of them.
