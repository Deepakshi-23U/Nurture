                <p>Immunity is the body’s way of preventing disease. Because a baby’s immune system is not fully developed at birth,</p>
                <p>babies face a greater risk of becoming infected and getting seriously ill. Vaccines help teach the immune system learn</p>
                <p>how to defend against germs. Vaccination protects your baby by helping build up their natural defenses.</p>
                <p>Vaccines, like medicine, can have some side effects. But most people who get vaccinated have only mild side effects or none at all. The most common side effects include fever, tiredness, body aches, and redness, swelling, and tenderness where the shot was given. Mild reactions usually go away on their own within a few days</p>
                <p>Serious, long-lasting side effects are extremely rare. We know they are rare because CDC tracks and investigates reports of serious side effects.</p>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children are exposed to thousands of germs every day. This happens through the food they eat, the air they breathe, and the things they put in their mouth.</li>
                    <li>Babies are born with immune systems that can fight most germs, but some germs cause serious or even deadly diseases a baby can’t handle. For those, babies need the help of vaccines.</li>
                    <li>Vaccines use very small amounts of antigens to help your child’s immune system recognize and learn to fight serious diseases. Antigens are the parts of a germ that cause the body’s immune system to go to work.</li>

                <p>Certain vaccines are safe and recommended for women before, during, and after pregnancy to help keep them and their babies healthy.</p>
                <p>The antibodies mothers develop in response to these vaccines not only protect them, but also cross the placenta and help protect their babies from serious diseases early in life.</p>
                <p>Vaccinating during pregnancy also helps protect a mother from getting a serious disease and then giving it to her newborn.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Some vaccines, especially live vaccines, should not be given to pregnant women because they may be harmful to the baby</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that vaccine recommendations for pregnant women are developed with the highest safety concerns for both mothers and babies.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>es. It is safe to receive routine vaccines right after giving birth, even while you are breastfeeding. However, yellow fever vaccine is not recommended for breastfeeding women unless travel to certain countries is unavoidable and a healthcare provider determines that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks</p>
                <p>Talk with your provider if you are considering yellow fever vaccine</p>
